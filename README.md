## Overview
The Twubric web application is designed to allow Twitter users to review their followers, view their Twubric scores, filter and sort them based on various criteria, and optionally remove certain followers. This solution is built using AngularJS and integrates with a mock API to fetch user data.

## Features
- Display a list of Twitter followers with their Twubric scores.
- Allow users to filter followers based on the dates when they joined Twitter.
- Enable sorting of followers based on Twubric Score, Friends, Influence, and Chirpiness.
- Provide a search function to dynamically filter followers based on usernames.
- Allow users to remove followers from the list.

## Implementation
The application consists of the following components:
- HTML templates for the UI layout.
- AngularJS controllers to manage user data and interactions.
- CSS stylesheets for styling using the Tailwind CSS framework.

## Solution
I'm glad to hear that you're finding the task of building a Twitter clone to be a valuable learning experience. It's great that you're able to combine resources from the internet with your own knowledge and experience to solve problems. Keep up the good work!
